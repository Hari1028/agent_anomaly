📄 GRAFANA LOCAL INSTALLATION + SQLITE PLUGIN SETUP (WINDOWS)
Step-by-Step Installation Guide
✅ 1. Download & Install Grafana (Windows)

Go to the official Grafana download page:
https://grafana.com/grafana/download

Select:
Windows Installer (64-bit)
Example file name:
grafana-enterprise_12.3.0_windows_amd64.msi

Run the installer:

Click Next

Accept license

Click Install

After installation, Grafana runs automatically as a Windows Service.

✅ 2. Verify Grafana Installation
Method A — Services

Press Win + R

Type: services.msc

Look for Grafana

Status should be Running

Method B — Browser Check

Open:

http://localhost:3000


Login:

Username: admin

Password: admin (you will be asked to change it)

If this page opens, Grafana is installed correctly.

✅ 3. Install SQLite Plugin

Grafana does NOT support SQLite by default.
To connect olist.sqlite, you must install the plugin.

Step 3.1 — Open Command Prompt as Administrator

Press Start

Type cmd

Right-click → Run as administrator

Step 3.2 — Navigate to Grafana installation directory
cd /d "C:\Program Files\GrafanaLabs\grafana"

Step 3.3 — Install SQLite plugin

Run:

bin\grafana-cli.exe plugins install frser-sqlite-datasource


If this plugin is not available, use the alternative:

bin\grafana-cli.exe plugins install marcusolsson-sqlite-datasource


Expected successful output:

✔ Downloaded and extracted frser-sqlite-datasource successfully


(A small temp-file error is okay — plugin still installs.)

✅ 4. Restart Grafana Service

Once plugin installation is complete, restart Grafana:

Option A — Command Prompt
net stop grafana
net start grafana

Option B — Services panel

Open services.msc

Find Grafana

Right-click → Restart

✅ 5. Verify Plugin Installation

Open Grafana:
http://localhost:3000

Go to Connections (left side menu)

Click Add Data Source

Search for: SQLite

You should see one of these:

SQLite by frser

SQLite (frser-sqlite-datasource)

Marcus Olsson SQLite Datasource

If SQLite appears → plugin installation is successful.

📌 At This Stage — Setup Completed

You now have:

✓ Grafana installed locally
✓ Grafana running as Windows service
✓ SQLite plugin installed
✓ Ready to add olist.sqlite as a datasource
